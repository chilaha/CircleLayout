CircleLayout
============

fun with Apple's circle layout

Apple's WWDC 2012 has a great video on custom Layouts for UICollectionViews

Advanced Collection Views and Building Custom Layouts

I downloaded the code but it was broken for iOS7.

So I studied UICollectionViews and fixed it.

While I was at it I had to test some ideas I had about implementing UICollectionViews into my latest app.

So here it is.

It could be very useful to those who need help with this intense API for UICollectionViews.

I've struggled with UICollectionViews but now seem to be getting it.

This demo app has 2 sections (an inner and outer circle)

Tapping a cell deletes it with some animation.

Tapping in space creates a new cell to a default position.

Pressing and holding a cell will let you drag it to a new position if you let go on top of another cell.

Enjoy.  It's fun.  More power to all.

Peace! out.
